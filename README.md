# NYT Sudoku

This app takes the sudoku from The New York Times everyday and sends it to me through Discord. I also did an analysis of ~4k sudokus from years past to understand how they are rated.

## The Daily
Scrapes NYT to send me a photo of the sudoku with candidates with the HoDoKu and SukakuExplainer ratings.

## The Historical Analysis
I used WaybackMachine to find about ~1400 links to past sudokus NYT has published and analyze them over time. I separated by day of the week, and looked at it over time as well. I also analyzed the ranges of each of the difficulty ratings.

## TODO
- Adding website (or in readme) to show the analyzed data
- Might change the Discord embed field
- Might integrate a graph of backtracking analysis
